            The self proclaimed internet atlas makes an attempt to describe the spatial anatomy of the internet in terms of it being a global platform or “space”. In theorizing a correlation between physical and virtual realities, it presents several models that may explain certain aspects of correlation between the two.

          <p class="col-lg-8 mx-auto fs-5 text-muted"> “Potentially the internet is everywhere, yet is a single entity; it is both the concept and the thing.” This is a debatable statement to me. I do not necessarily agree with the fact that the internet is everywhere. There are several places around the world with internet blackouts and restrictions. In the case of restricted or lack of access to the cyberspace, this is an assumption that tends to present a skewed perspective. So the question on whether it is a huge mass that encompasses the globe or a single point concentrating all activity is very important here.

I personally don’t see it a a a huge mass or a single point but instead as series of constantly evolving ecological scapes across the globe. This is because visualizing the internet into physicality cannot happen without understating it’s global scale human dynamics. It is mentioned in the reading that China doesn’t have google and Morocco doesn’t have google maps, asserting that the internet appears differently in different cultures. Thus, the internet geographically transforms as a space in different locations. This makes more sense when the cyberspace is juxtaposed onto the physical world. How about constructions of the cyberspace itself? The reticular concentration within the internet is probably it’s defining characteristic. Unlike the physical realm the internet can hold crowding without necessarily expanding.
